This is the textbook _Linear Algebra_ by Jim Hefferon.  It is Free.

It covers the standard material for a US undergraduate first course: linear systems and Gauss's Method, vector spaces, linear maps and matrices, determinants, and eigenvectors and eigenvalues, as well as additional topics such as introductions to various applications.  It has extensive exercise sets with worked answers to all exercises including proofs, beamer slides for classroom use, and a lab manual for computer work (using _Sage_).

It has been tested over many years at a number of different schools and by a number of different instructors so it is ready to use today.

The approach is developmental.  Although everything is proved, it does not start with an assumption that the students are already able at abstract work.  Instead this book works to help the instructor raise each student's level of mathematical maturity.  It introduces the material with a great deal of motivation, many computational examples, and exercises that range from routine verifications to a few challenges.

_Linear Algebra_ is Free: you are welcome to use it in either electronic or paper forms, as an in-class text or for personal use.  For more license information as well as additional description including links to reviews, see http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra.

This repository contains the source for all the material, including the text, the answers, the slides, the lab manual with Sage source, and all graphics.  It is written in LaTeX and related systems.
